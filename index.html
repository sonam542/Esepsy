        <h1>The Scienc of Self-Discipline By Peter Hollions</h1>
        <div class="container">

            <p>
                Hi, my name is Sonam Tamang, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering major at The Ohio State University.
                 This website documents my experience applying insights from the book The Science of Self-Discipline by Peter Hollins to
                  improve my focus and build better habits during the Spring 2025 semester. My goal is to share the lessons I learned, 
                  how I applied them, and the progress
                 I’ve made so others can benefit too.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Book Overview and Connection to My Goals
            </h3>
            <p>

                I chose The Science of Self-Discipline by Peter Hollins 
                because I wanted to strengthen my ability to stay focused 
                and consistent, especially with challenging tasks like 
                coding assignments and sticking to a gym routine. The book
                 offers actionable strategies to resist temptation, break 
                 bad habits, and push forward when motivation fades. 
                 These ideas directly supported the personal goals I
                  set for this semester.
            </p>

            <h3>
                My Goals
            </h3>
            <p>
                I focused on two main goals for this Sementer: <br> <br>

                1) Stay focused and avoid procrastination on coding assignments.
                I often get overwhelmed by complex programming tasks and end up 
                procrastinating or avoiding them.

                <br>
                <br>

               2) Maintain a consistent gym routine by working out at least four times a week.
                In the past, I struggled with consistency due to distractions or lack of motivation.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                I chose these goals because they both require discipline, long-term effort, 
                and the ability to push through discomfort and gain skills I wanted to improve.

            <h3> Strategies I used </h3>

            <p>
                <strong>The 10-Minute Rule:</strong> 
                To help me stay consistent and overcome procrastination, I’ve been using 
                the 10-Minute Rule — a simple but effective strategy where I commit to 
                starting a task for just 10 minutes. More often than not, once I get started, 
                I find myself working well beyond that initial time. This method has been 
                especially helpful for tackling challenging coding assignments.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>
                To track my progress and build a habit of focused work, I use the 
                <strong>Forest app</strong>. It visually represents my daily focus sessions, 
                helping me stay motivated and accountable by "planting trees" as I work. 
                Over the past month, I’ve accumulated <strong>12 hours</strong> of focused time, 
                which reflects steady effort and growth.
            </p>

            </p>


            <p>
                <strong>Precommitment Strategy:</strong> 
                I removed distractions by using website blockers and placing my phone in another room 
                during deep work sessions. I specifically used <strong>StayFocusd</strong> (for blocking distracting websites on Chrome) 
                and <strong>FocusMe</strong> (for blocking both websites and apps) to help maintain focus. 
                These tools significantly reduced the temptation to procrastinate and allowed me to stay in a productive flow state.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Implementation Intentions:</strong> 
                To stay consistent with my gym goal, I created specific “if-then” plans that tied my intention to a clear trigger. 
                For example: <em>If it’s Monday at 6 PM, then I go to the gym.</em> This strategy helped turn my goal into an automatic habit by linking it to a time and context I regularly encounter.
            </p>
            

            <p>
                <strong>Identity-Based habits</strong>
                I started telling myself, “I’m someone who follows through,” and built routines that matched that identity. This mental shift helped me stay consistent.

            <h3> Some of my favorate quotes from the book</h3>

            <p>
                “We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.”

            </p>

            <p>
                “The next time you feel that you’re about to give in to an urge or temptation, stop 
                and ask yourself how you will feel ten minutes, ten hours, and ten days from now.”


            </p>

            <h4>Tracking My progress </h4>

            <p> 
                <strong> Coding Discipline Tracking:</strong>
                I used a time-tracking app to log how many minutes I spent on deep work each day. Over 3 weeks, I saw an increase in focused study sessions from ~30 minutes/day to over 90 minutes/day, 4–5 times a week.
            </p>

            <h3>Major Takeaways and Reflections</h3>

            <p> 
                <strong>Discipline beats motivation.</strong>
                I learned that starting is the hardest part, and if I just push through the initial resistance, everything gets easier.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Small wins create momentum.</strong>
                Whether it was completing a short coding task or finishing a gym session, each win built confidence and kept me moving forward.


            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Your environment matters.</strong>

                By designing my environment to reduce distractions (no phone, study timer, clear to-do list), I was more productive and focused.
            </p>

            <p>This project changed how I approach my work and habits. I’m no longer waiting to “feel motivated”—I rely on systems, habits, and discipline. I’ve become more mindful about how I use my time and confident in my ability to stick with difficult tasks. While I haven’t perfected everything, I made real progress toward both of my goals.
