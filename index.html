        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Sonam Tamang, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. When I first entered college, I was excited about programming and the challenges of my major. However, I quickly realized that the transition from high school to university required much more self-discipline than I initially anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I enjoyed coding, I often found myself distracted or procrastinating on assignments, which led to feeling overwhelmed. I also struggled to maintain a consistent gym routine, which impacted my health and well-being. I realized that if I wanted to thrive academically and stay physically healthy, I needed to improve my self-discipline.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Last semester, I faced several challenges with procrastination, especially when it came to coding assignments and preparing for exams. I would often find myself spending hours on social media, watching random videos, or organizing tasks that gave me the illusion of productivity but didn’t move me forward. Even when I planned to start early, I struggled with actually sitting down and focusing, which caused me to fall behind on deadlines. This cycle of delaying important tasks led to increased stress, late nights, and lower-quality work. I constantly felt overwhelmed and frustrated with myself for not using my time wisely, even though I wanted to improve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In addition to academic struggles, I also frequently skipped gym sessions, telling myself that I had too much schoolwork to focus on. While it seemed like a valid excuse in the moment, it became a habit that held me back from achieving consistency and seeing any physical progress. The lack of routine affected not only my fitness goals but also my energy levels and motivation overall. After reflecting on these patterns, I realized I needed more than just good intentions—I needed a structured approach to manage my time better, reduce distractions, and create sustainable habits. That’s when I began searching for strategies that could help me build discipline in both academic and personal areas of my life.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Improve my ability to stay focused and avoid procrastination during coding assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Maintain a consistent gym routine by exercising at least four times a week.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Book Selection</h2>
        <p>
            I chose <em>The Science of Self-Discipline</em> by Peter Hollins because it offers actionable advice to overcome procrastination, stay focused, and build strong habits. The book explains how mental toughness and discipline have the power to transform your life, which was exactly what I felt I needed at the time. I was struggling to stay consistent with my academic work and personal routines, often getting distracted or losing motivation. Hollins breaks down complex ideas into simple, clear strategies that anyone can follow. He emphasizes that discipline is not something you're born with, but something you can train and strengthen over time, much like a muscle.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The practical and real-world strategies in the book aligned perfectly with the goals I had set for myself, particularly in improving my focus during coding assignments and maintaining a consistent gym routine. I found the techniques such as the 10-minute rule, precommitment strategy, and identity-based habit formation especially useful in managing distractions and staying on track. The book helped me shift my mindset from waiting for motivation to taking action first and building momentum. Overall, it became a guide for building the habits and mindset I needed to achieve both academic success and personal growth.

        <h2>Strategies/Ideas from the Book</h2>

        <p><strong>The 10-Minute Rule:</strong><br>
            This technique suggests that you commit to working on a task for just 10 minutes. I used this strategy with my coding assignments. Telling myself to “just start” for 10 minutes made the task feel less intimidating and helped me build momentum.
        </p>
        <p>“The next time you feel that you’re about to give in to an urge or temptation, stop and ask yourself how you will feel ten minutes, ten hours, and ten days from now. The 10-10-10 Rule may not seem all that powerful, but it’s effective because it forces you to think about your future self and to see how your actions will affect you in the future—for better or worse.”
            <br>
            — Peter Hollins, The Science of Self-Discipline
        </p>
      

        <p><strong>Precommitment Strategy:</strong><br>
            I used tools like <strong>StayFocusd</strong> and <strong>FocusMe</strong> to block distracting websites and apps during study hours. I also placed my phone in another room. These steps eliminated temptations and allowed me to stay in a deep work state for longer periods.
        </p>

        <p>"The Precommitment Strategy is about setting yourself up for success by making decisions in advance that limit the opportunity for distractions or excuses later. By locking yourself into a course of action before you face the temptation, you take away the power of procrastination and increase the chances of following through."

        <p><strong>Implementation Intentions:</strong><br>
            I made specific if-then plans for the gym. For example: <em>If it’s Monday at 6 PM, then I go to the gym.</em> This made workouts a part of my schedule and removed the mental friction of deciding when to go.
        </p>

        <p>"Implementation Intentions are a powerful way to transform good intentions into action. By specifying exactly when, where, and how you'll take action, you create a mental plan that guides you to act in moments of opportunity, bypassing the mental hurdles of procrastination."

        </p>

        <p><strong>Identity-Based Habits:</strong><br>
            I started telling myself, “I’m someone who follows through,” and made decisions that matched that identity. This small mindset shift made it easier to stick to new habits because I began seeing discipline as a part of who I am.
        </p>

        <p>"Identity-Based Habits are built not by focusing on what you want to achieve, but by who you want to become. When you start viewing yourself as the type of person who consistently shows up, your actions align with that identity, making discipline feel more natural and effortless."

        <h2>Tracking My Progress</h2>

        <p><strong>Coding Discipline:</strong><br>
            I used the <strong>Forest App</strong> to stay on track during focused coding sessions. Initially, I studied for about 30 minutes a day, but gradually increased to over 90 minutes per session, 4 to 5 times a week. Watching the trees grow gave me a visual sense of progress, which helped me stay motivated and consistent.

        <p><strong>Fitness Habit:</strong><br>
            I used a journal to log gym visits and followed my scheduled workout times. By checking off each session, I built momentum and accountability, which helped me hit my goal of four workouts per week.

        <h2>Major Takeaways and Reflections</h2>

        <p><strong>Discipline beats motivation:</strong><br>
            I’ve learned that motivation is fleeting, but discipline can carry you through when motivation fails. Starting is always the hardest part, but once I begin, everything becomes more manageable.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Small wins build momentum:</strong><br>
            Completing a short assignment or going to the gym for just 20 minutes added up over time. These wins built confidence and made it easier to keep going.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Your environment matters:</strong><br>
            By controlling distractions (like my phone and unproductive tabs) and creating a focused space, I got more done with less effort. My environment became a reflection of my goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project has helped me shift from waiting to feel motivated to taking consistent action. I rely on systems and habits, not willpower alone. While I’m still improving, I’ve made real progress and feel more confident in my ability to follow through on difficult tasks.
