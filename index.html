        <h1>The Scienc of Self-Discipline By Peter Hollions</h1>
        <div class="container">

            <p>
                Hi, my name is Sonam Tamang, a third-year Computer Science and Engineering major at The Ohio State University.
                 This website documents my experience applying insights from the book The Science of Self-Discipline by Peter Hollins to
                  improve my focus and build better habits during the Spring 2025 semester. My goal is to share the lessons I learned, 
                  how I applied them, and the progress
                 Iâ€™ve made so others can benefit too.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Book Overview and Connection to My Goals
            </h3>
            <p>

                I chose The Science of Self-Discipline by Peter Hollins 
                because I wanted to strengthen my ability to stay focused 
                and consistent, especially with challenging tasks like 
                coding assignments and sticking to a gym routine. The book
                 offers actionable strategies to resist temptation, break 
                 bad habits, and push forward when motivation fades. 
                 These ideas directly supported the personal goals I
                  set for this semester.
            </p>

            <h3>
                My Goals
            </h3>
            <p>
                I focused on two main goals for this Sementer: <br> <br>

                1) Stay focused and avoid procrastination on coding assignments.
                I often get overwhelmed by complex programming tasks and end up 
                procrastinating or avoiding them.

                <br>
                <br>

               2) Maintain a consistent gym routine by working out at least four times a week.
                In the past, I struggled with consistency due to distractions or lack of motivation.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                I chose these goals because they both require discipline, long-term effort, 
                and the ability to push through discomfort and gain skills I wanted to improve.
            </p>

            <h3> Strategies I used </h3>

            <p>
                <strong>The 10-Minute Rule: </strong>
                This strategy helped me overcome resistance by telling myself to 
                start a task for just 10 minutes. Once I started, I often ended 
                up working longer. This was especially useful for getting started 
                on difficult coding tasks.
