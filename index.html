        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Sonam Tamang, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. When I first entered college, I was excited about programming and the challenges of my major. However, I quickly realized that the transition from high school to university required much more self-discipline than I initially anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I enjoyed coding, I often found myself distracted or procrastinating on assignments, which led to feeling overwhelmed. I also struggled to maintain a consistent gym routine, which impacted my health and well-being. I realized that if I wanted to thrive academically and stay physically healthy, I needed to improve my self-discipline.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Last semester, I faced several challenges with procrastination, especially when it came to coding assignments and preparing for exams. I would often find myself spending hours on social media, watching random videos, or organizing tasks that gave me the illusion of productivity but didn’t move me forward. Even when I planned to start early, I struggled with actually sitting down and focusing, which caused me to fall behind on deadlines. This cycle of delaying important tasks led to increased stress, late nights, and lower-quality work. I constantly felt overwhelmed and frustrated with myself for not using my time wisely, even though I wanted to improve.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In addition to academic struggles, I also frequently skipped gym sessions, telling myself that I had too much schoolwork to focus on. While it seemed like a valid excuse in the moment, it became a habit that held me back from achieving consistency and seeing any physical progress. The lack of routine affected not only my fitness goals but also my energy levels and motivation overall. After reflecting on these patterns, I realized I needed more than just good intentions—I needed a structured approach to manage my time better, reduce distractions, and create sustainable habits. That’s when I began searching for strategies that could help me build discipline in both academic and personal areas of my life.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Improve my ability to stay focused and avoid procrastination during coding assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Maintain a consistent gym routine by exercising at least four times a week.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Book Selection</h2>
        <p>
            I chose <em>The Science of Self-Discipline</em> by Peter Hollins because it offers actionable advice to overcome procrastination, stay focused, and build strong habits. The book explains how mental toughness and discipline have the power to transform your life, which was exactly what I felt I needed at the time. I was struggling to stay consistent with my academic work and personal routines, often getting distracted or losing motivation. Hollins breaks down complex ideas into simple, clear strategies that anyone can follow. He emphasizes that discipline is not something you're born with, but something you can train and strengthen over time, much like a muscle.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The practical and real-world strategies in the book aligned perfectly with the goals I had set for myself, particularly in improving my focus during coding assignments and maintaining a consistent gym routine. I found the techniques such as the 10-minute rule, precommitment strategy, and identity-based habit formation especially useful in managing distractions and staying on track. The book helped me shift my mindset from waiting for motivation to taking action first and building momentum. Overall, it became a guide for building the habits and mindset I needed to achieve both academic success and personal growth.

        <h2>Strategies/Ideas from the Book</h2>

        <p><strong>The 10-Minute Rule:</strong><br>
            This technique suggests that you commit to working on a task for just 10 minutes. I used this strategy with my coding assignments. Telling myself to “just start” for 10 minutes made the task feel less intimidating and helped me build momentum.
        </p>
        <p>“The next time you feel that you’re about to give in to an urge or temptation, stop and ask yourself how you will feel ten minutes, ten hours, and ten days from now. The 10-10-10 Rule may not seem all that powerful, but it’s effective because it forces you to think about your future self and to see how your actions will affect you in the future—for better or worse.”
            <br>
            — Peter Hollins, The Science of Self-Discipline
        </p>
      

        <p><strong>Precommitment Strategy:</strong><br>
            I used tools like <strong>StayFocusd</strong> and <strong>FocusMe</strong> to block distracting websites and apps during study hours. I also placed my phone in another room. These steps eliminated temptations and allowed me to stay in a deep work state for longer periods.
        </p>

        <p>“One strategy to help you master delaying gratification is to think about your future self more—the one who will be rewarded for your temporary suffering. Integrate your view of your future self as one and the same with the you that is acting now. When you’re emotionally one with your future self, it becomes easier for you to act for the good of your future self instead of just following the whims of your present self.”

        <p><strong>Implementation Intentions:</strong><br>
            I made specific if-then plans for the gym. For example: <em>If it’s Tusday at 11 am, then I go to the gym.</em> This made workouts a part of my schedule and removed the mental friction of deciding when to go.
        </p>

        <p>“You can plan for the future and delay starting all you want, but the best thing you can do is to just begin. It doesn’t matter if that’s getting healthy, writing a book, or starting a business—the best time to start is now. There is almost no perfect timing you should be waiting for. Waiting to have more money, resources, or experience very rarely increases your odds of accomplishing the goal in the future. You only have the chance to succeed once you’ve started, and you can always figure out the details along the way.”

        <p><strong>Identity-Based Habits:</strong><br>
            I started telling myself, “I’m someone who follows through,” and made decisions that matched that identity. This small mindset shift made it easier to stick to new habits because I began seeing discipline as a part of who I am.
        </p>

        <p>“Make positive actions and behaviors the default option for you. That way, you wouldn’t even need to exert more effort choosing the better and more self-disciplined of two or more options—you already have a single course of action laid out in front of you and you only need to follow it.”

        <h2>Tracking My Progress</h2>

        <p><strong>Coding Discipline:</strong><br>
            In line with the strategies outlined in The Science of Self-Discipline, I used the Forest App to stay on track during focused coding sessions. The app provided a visual cue of progress as I watched the trees grow each time I stayed focused, which helped reinforce my commitment to staying on task. This connects with Peter Hollins' idea of using visual reminders and rewards to maintain discipline, especially the importance of tracking small wins. By gradually increasing my study time from 30 minutes to 90 minutes per session, I was able to build momentum and consistency, key elements in creating lasting habits as emphasized in the book. The app acted as both a motivator and a tool for focusing my energy, demonstrating how small actions can accumulate into significant progress.

        <p><strong>Fitness Habit:</strong><br>
            To stay on track with my fitness routine, I used a journal to log my gym visits and track my weekly progress. I scheduled specific workout times and treated them as important commitments. After each session, I checked it off in my journal, which helped me stay accountable and motivated. This approach aligns with the strategies from The Science of Self-Discipline by Peter Hollins, especially the use of implementation intentions and tracking small wins. Following this method helped me build consistency and reach my goal of working out three times per week.

        <h2>Major Takeaways and Reflections</h2>

        <p><strong>Discipline beats motivation:</strong><br> I have learned that motivation is fleeting, but discipline can carry you through when motivation fails. Starting is always the hardest part, but once I begin, everything becomes more manageable. This lesson aligns with Peter Hollins’ emphasis in *The Science of Self-Discipline* that discipline is a skill that can be developed over time. He highlights how motivation is unreliable, and it is through discipline, through consistent actions and systems, that we achieve long-term success. By focusing on discipline instead of waiting for motivation to strike, I have found it easier to begin tasks and stay committed, even when motivation is low. </p>

        <p><strong>Small wins build momentum:</strong><br> Completing a short assignment or going to the gym for just 20 minutes added up over time. These wins built confidence and made it easier to keep going. This concept is closely related to Hollins' idea of using small wins to create momentum and strengthen self-discipline. He explains that celebrating small successes helps us build positive habits and boosts our motivation to continue. By acknowledging these little victories, I have realized that progress doesn’t always have to come in big steps. It is the consistency of small actions that leads to major outcomes. </p>

        <p><strong>Your environment matters:</strong><br> By controlling distractions like my phone and unproductive tabs and creating a focused space, I got more done with less effort. My environment became a reflection of my goals. This is something Hollins stresses in his book when he discusses how shaping your environment can support your discipline. He explains that removing temptations and creating an environment that encourages focus is a key strategy for building self-discipline. By consciously controlling my surroundings, I have made it easier to stay on task and avoid distractions, aligning my external world with my internal goals. </p>

        <p> This project has helped me shift from waiting to feel motivated to taking consistent action. I rely on systems and habits, not willpower alone. Hollins advocates for the importance of systems and routines in building discipline, which has been a transformative concept for me. While I am still improving, I have made real progress and feel more confident in my ability to follow through on difficult tasks. Through this journey, I have learned that discipline, fueled by well-structured systems and positive habits, is the key to long-term success. I now see this as more important than relying solely on motivation. </p>
