        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Sonam Tamang, and I am currently a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at The Ohio State University. When I first entered college, I was excited about programming and the challenges of my major. However, I quickly realized that the transition from high school to university required much more self-discipline than I initially anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I enjoyed coding, I often found myself distracted or procrastinating on assignments, which led to feeling overwhelmed. I also struggled to maintain a consistent gym routine, which impacted my health and well-being. I realized that if I wanted to thrive academically and stay physically healthy, I needed to improve my self-discipline.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
            Last semester, I faced several challenges with procrastination, especially regarding coding assignments and preparing for exams. I would often get distracted by social media, online videos, or planning things that seemed productive but weren’t. This cycle led to stress and low productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also frequently skipped gym sessions, telling myself I had too much work. This inconsistency prevented me from seeing physical progress. After reflecting on these challenges, I knew I needed a structured approach to manage my time, reduce distractions, and form better habits.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Improve my ability to stay focused and avoid procrastination during coding assignments.</li>
            <li><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Maintain a consistent gym routine by exercising at least four times a week.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="book" class="container">
        <h2>Book Selection</h2>
        <p>
            I chose <em>The Science of Self-Discipline</em> by Peter Hollins because it offers actionable advice to overcome procrastination, stay focused, and build strong habits. The book explains how mental toughness and discipline have the power to transform your life, which was exactly what I felt I needed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Its practical and real-world strategies aligned perfectly with the goals I had for both my academic progress and personal habits.

        <h2>Strategies/Ideas from the Book</h2>

        <p><strong>The 10-Minute Rule:</strong><br>
            This technique suggests that you commit to working on a task for just 10 minutes. I used this strategy with my coding assignments. Telling myself to “just start” for 10 minutes made the task feel less intimidating and helped me build momentum.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Precommitment Strategy:</strong><br>
            I used tools like <strong>StayFocusd</strong> and <strong>FocusMe</strong> to block distracting websites and apps during study hours. I also placed my phone in another room. These steps eliminated temptations and allowed me to stay in a deep work state for longer periods.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Implementation Intentions:</strong><br>
            I made specific if-then plans for the gym. For example: <em>If it’s Monday at 6 PM, then I go to the gym.</em> This made workouts a part of my schedule and removed the mental friction of deciding when to go.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Identity-Based Habits:</strong><br>
            I started telling myself, “I’m someone who follows through,” and made decisions that matched that identity. This small mindset shift made it easier to stick to new habits because I began seeing discipline as a part of who I am.
        </p>

    <section id="tracking" class="container">
        <h2>Tracking My Progress</h2>

        <p><strong>Coding Discipline:</strong><br>
            I used the <strong>Forest App</strong> to track focused coding sessions. Over time, I went from studying ~30 minutes a day to over 90 minutes per session, 4–5 times a week. I visually saw my trees grow, which kept me motivated and consistent.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Fitness Habit:</strong><br>
            I used a journal to log gym visits and followed my scheduled workout times. By checking off each session, I built momentum and accountability, which helped me hit my goal of four workouts per week.

    <section id="reflection" class="container">
        <h2>Major Takeaways and Reflections</h2>

        <p><strong>Discipline beats motivation:</strong><br>
            I’ve learned that motivation is fleeting, but discipline can carry you through when motivation fails. Starting is always the hardest part, but once I begin, everything becomes more manageable.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Small wins build momentum:</strong><br>
            Completing a short assignment or going to the gym for just 20 minutes added up over time. These wins built confidence and made it easier to keep going.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Your environment matters:</strong><br>
            By controlling distractions (like my phone and unproductive tabs) and creating a focused space, I got more done with less effort. My environment became a reflection of my goals.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project has helped me shift from waiting to feel motivated to taking consistent action. I rely on systems and habits, not willpower alone. While I’m still improving, I’ve made real progress and feel more confident in my ability to follow through on difficult tasks.
